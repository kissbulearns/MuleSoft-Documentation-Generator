# MuleSoft Documentation Generator (POC)
The MuleSoft Documentation Generator is a proof-of-concept (POC) tool designed to address critical documentation challenges in MuleSoft application development. It automatically generates comprehensive, interactive HTML documentation by analyzing XML configurations and JAR files.

## Problem Statement

When working with MuleSoft applications, developers and architects often face several challenges:

1. **Documentation Maintenance**: Keeping documentation up-to-date with code changes is time-consuming and often neglected.
2. **Code Understanding**: New team members struggle to understand complex MuleSoft applications, especially when dealing with multiple flows and transformations.
3. **Migration Challenges**: Upgrading MuleSoft applications (e.g., from 4.4 to 4.9) requires careful analysis of compatibility issues, especially with Java 17.
4. **Configuration Management**: Managing and comparing configurations across different environments (UAT, PROD) can be error-prone.
5. **Error Handling**: Understanding and documenting error handling strategies across the application is often overlooked.

## Solution

This Proof of Concept (POC) tool aims to address these challenges by automatically generating comprehensive documentation from MuleSoft applications. It analyzes XML configurations, JAR files, and generates interactive HTML documentation that includes:

- **Flow Analysis**: Visual representation of flow relationships and dependencies
- **Configuration Documentation**: Environment-specific configurations and comparisons
- **DataWeave Transformations**: Analysis of data transformations with complexity metrics
- **Error Handling Documentation**: Comprehensive overview of error handling strategies
- **Java 17 Compatibility Analysis**: Assessment of potential issues when upgrading to Java 17

## Current State (POC)

⚠️ **Important**: This is a Proof of Concept and not production-ready. The tool is in an early development stage with the following limitations:

1. **Limited Coverage**: Not all MuleSoft features and connectors are fully supported
2. **Basic Analysis**: Some complex scenarios may not be accurately analyzed
3. **Known Issues**: 
   - JavaScript template rendering needs improvement
   - Some edge cases in flow analysis may be missed
   - Limited support for custom components
4. **Performance**: Large applications may take significant time to process

## Features

- **XML Parsing**: Extract configurations from MuleSoft XML files
- **JAR Processing**: Analyze MuleSoft applications packaged as JAR files
- **Flow Analysis**: Identify flows, subflows, and their relationships
- **Visual Flow Diagrams**: Generate interactive flow diagrams
- **Environment Configuration**: Compare configurations across environments
- **DataWeave Transformations**: Document and analyze data transformations
- **Error Handling Analysis**: Review error handling strategies
- **Metadata Extraction**: Document application metadata and dependencies
- **Java 17 Compatibility**: Analyze potential issues for Java 17 migration

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Required Python packages (see requirements.txt)

### Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Basic Usage

```bash
# For XML files
python src/main.py --input=path/to/xml/directory --output=path/to/output/directory --name="Interface Name"

# For JAR file
python src/main.py --input=path/to/mulesoft.jar --output=path/to/output/directory --name="Interface Name"
```
